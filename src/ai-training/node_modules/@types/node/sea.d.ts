/**
 * This feature allows the distribution of a Node.js application conveniently to a
 * system that does not have Node.js installed.
 *
 * Node.js supports the creation of [single executable applications](https://github.com/nodejs/single-executable) by allowing
 * the injection of a blob prepared by Node.js, which can contain a bundled script,
 * into the `node` binary. During start up, the program checks if anything has been
 * injected. If the blob is found, it executes the script in the blob. Otherwise
 * Node.js operates as it normally does.
 *
 * The single executable application feature currently only supports running a
 * single embedded script using the `CommonJS` module system.
 *
 * Users can create a single executable application from their bundled script
 * with the `node` binary itself and any tool which can inject resources into the
 * binary.
 *
 * Here are the steps for creating a single executable application using one such
 * tool, [postject](https://github.com/nodejs/postject):
 *
 * 1. Create a JavaScript file:
 * ```bash
