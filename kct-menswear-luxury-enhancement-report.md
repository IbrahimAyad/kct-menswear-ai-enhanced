## 🔧 Technical Implementations

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Defensive Programming Example
const getPrimaryImage = () => {
  const images = product?.images;
  if (typeof images === 'object' && images) {
    if (images.hero) {
      return {
        url: images.hero.url || images.hero.cdn_url || '/placeholder-product.jpg',
        alt: images.hero.alt || product?.name || 'Product image'
      };
    }
  }
  return { url: '/placeholder-product.jpg', alt: product?.name || 'Product image' };
};
```

### Safe Array Operations
```typescript
// Before: products.map()
// After: (products || []).map()
{(product.features || []).slice(0, 2).map((feature, index) => (
  <span key={index} className="luxury-badge">
    {feature}
  </span>
))}
```

### API Integration
```typescript
// Enhanced API calls with error handling
const featuredResponse = await fetch('/api/products/enhanced?status=active&featured=true&limit=6');
const trendingResponse = await fetch('/api/products/enhanced?status=active&trending=true&limit=8');
```
