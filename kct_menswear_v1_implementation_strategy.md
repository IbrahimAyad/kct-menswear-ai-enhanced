## 2. Project Architecture Overview

The KCT Menswear platform is built on a modern, decoupled architecture designed for scalability and performance:

-   **Frontend**: A **Next.js 14** application deployed on **Vercel**, providing a fast and responsive user experience.
-   **Backend**: A **Supabase** instance serves as the backend, utilizing a **PostgreSQL** database and serverless **Edge Functions** for API endpoints.
-   **Admin Dashboard**: A React Native for Web application, available at `https://rtbbsdcrfbha.space.minimax.io`, for managing orders, products, and other business operations.
-   **Dual Product Architecture**: The platform utilizes a hybrid approach to product management, with "Core Products" managed in Stripe and "Catalog Products" managed in Supabase.

## 3. Detailed Product Structure Analysis

The product catalog is extensive and diverse, featuring a dual architecture to accommodate different product types:

-   **Core Products**: **28 core products**, including basic suits, shirts, and solid-colored ties, are managed directly in Stripe. These are high-volume, standard items with straightforward pricing.
-   **Tie Variations**: An extensive collection of **77 tie colors**, available in three widths, plus bow ties. These are priced individually at **$24.99** or as a bulk offer of **5 for $99**.
-   **Pre-built Bundles**: **66 pre-configured bundles** that combine a suit, shirt, and tie at three distinct price points: **$199, $229, and $249**.
-   **Catalog Products**: Over **150 custom catalog products** are managed in the Supabase database. This allows for greater flexibility in pricing, inventory, and product details.
-   **Total Products**: The `products_enhanced` table in the Supabase database contains approximately **177 total products**, with a flexible JSONB structure for storing image URLs.

## 4. Current Technical Status

The platform is in a partially completed state, with some key features implemented and others requiring attention:

-   **Enhanced Products API**: The primary product data is served through the `/api/products/enhanced` endpoint. This API is considered the main source of truth for product information.
-   **Production Stability**: Recent fixes have been applied to address critical server-side rendering (SSR) crashes caused by improper handling of `.map()` operations on potentially null or undefined arrays.
-   **Homepage Implementation**: The homepage has been updated to use the `EnhancedProductCard` component, which correctly fetches data from the enhanced products API.
-   **API Inconsistencies**: A significant issue is that some pages, particularly collection and product detail pages, are still using outdated or inconsistent methods for fetching product data. This technical debt needs to be resolved to ensure data consistency and predictable frontend behavior.

## 5. Integration Architecture

The platform is integrated with several third-party services to provide a complete e-commerce solution:

-   **Payment Processing**:
    -   **Core Products**: Payments for core products are processed through Stripe using a Payment Intent created via the `/stripe-payment-intent` endpoint.
    -   **Catalog Products**: Orders for catalog products are created directly in the Supabase database via the `/order-management` endpoint, with payment processing handled separately or through a different integration.
    -   **Mixed Carts**: Carts containing both core and catalog products require a dual processing system to handle the different payment flows.
-   **Shipping**: The **EasyPost API** is used for shipping rate calculation and label generation. The system is configured with **11 package templates** to accommodate various order sizes.
-   **Email Automation**: **SendGrid** is integrated for sending transactional emails, triggered by various order lifecycle events.
-   **Admin API**: A comprehensive admin API provides endpoints for managing orders, calculating shipping rates, creating shipping labels, and other administrative tasks.

## 6. Key API Endpoints for Frontend

The following API endpoints are essential for the frontend application to interact with the backend services:

-   `POST /api/products/enhanced`: Fetches the enhanced product list.
-   `POST /stripe-payment-intent`: Creates a Stripe Payment Intent for processing payments for Core Products.
-   `POST /order-management`: Creates, updates, and retrieves orders in the Supabase database.
-   `POST /shipping-rates`: Calculates shipping costs using the EasyPost API.
-   `POST /shipping-label`: Generates shipping labels through the EasyPost API.
-   `POST /send-email`: Sends transactional emails via the SendGrid integration.
-   `POST /order-automation`: Triggers automated workflows based on order events.

## 7. V1 Completion Strategy

To achieve a successful V1 launch, the following strategic priorities must be addressed:

1.  **Technical Consistency**: The highest priority is to ensure that all pages and components that display product information are refactored to use the `/api/products/enhanced` endpoint. This will eliminate data inconsistencies and provide a single source of truth for product data.
2.  **Product Display Standardization**: A unified set of components should be created for displaying different product types, including core products, bundles, and catalog items. This will ensure a consistent user experience across the entire product catalog.
3.  **Bundle Builder Implementation**: A key feature for V1 is the development of an interactive bundle builder. This will allow customers to create their own custom suit, shirt, and tie combinations with real-time price updates.
4.  **Modern UI/UX**: The user interface and user experience must be elevated to match the standards of a luxury fashion brand. This includes implementing a consistent design system, using high-quality imagery, and creating a visually appealing and intuitive shopping experience.
5.  **Integration Completion**: The frontend application should fully utilize the existing admin API capabilities for order management, shipping, and email notifications.

## 8. Critical Areas for V1

To ensure a successful V1 launch, the following areas require immediate attention and focused effort:

-   **Component Standardization**: Develop a set of reusable and consistent components for displaying products, including `ProductCard`, `BundleCard`, and `TieVariationCard`.
-   **Bundle Hover Effects**: Implement engaging hover effects on bundle products, displaying the individual items included in the bundle and a model view.
-   **Custom Bundle Builder**: Create an intuitive and interactive interface for customers to build their own bundles, with real-time price calculations.
-   **Pricing Integration**: Ensure that the pricing displayed on the frontend is accurately synced with Stripe for core products and dynamically calculated for custom bundles.
-   **Mobile Responsiveness**: The entire user experience must be optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless and consistent experience across all screen sizes.
-   **Performance Optimization**: Remove all `console.log` statements and other debugging artifacts from the production codebase. Optimize API calls and image loading to ensure fast page load times.

## 9. Recommendations

To achieve the V1 vision, the following recommendations should be followed:

-   **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: The development team should focus on leveraging the robust backend infrastructure that is already in place. The existing APIs for order management, shipping, and payments are well-documented and provide the necessary functionality for a complete e-commerce experience.
-   **Prioritize Frontend Development**: The majority of the remaining work for V1 is on the frontend. The team should prioritize the development of a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface that aligns with the KCT Menswear brand.
-   **Adopt a Component-Based Approach**: A component-based approach to frontend development will ensure consistency, reusability, and maintainability.
